## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- Framer Motion
- Vite
- Tailwind
- React-Hook-Form
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I was able to extensively practice React useContext Hook, React Hook Form and Framer Motion during the development of this project. I also made use of localStorage to be able to store the values while still in a particular session of usage. I'm quite proud of myself and this project. I learnt a lot and hope to continue learning and be the best!
